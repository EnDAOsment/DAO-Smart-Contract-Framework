The EnDAOsment's modular governance framework utilizes a CORE contract that acts as a central hub, dynamically determining which governance module, either an Approval or Quadratic Governor, is invoked based on the current stage of a proposal. This modular design allows for a flexible and adaptable governance system that can evolve with the needs of the DAO. 

Modular Governance: The framework utilizes a modular design, enabling the interchange and customization of governance components. This avoids the need for forking and rewriting entire contracts when adapting to changing needs or requirements.

Here's a breakdown of how this framework would operates:
1. CORE Contract: This central contract serves as the entry point for all governance proposals and holds the logic for determining which specific Governor contract to use at each stage of a proposal's lifecycle.
2. Approval Governor: This Governor handles proposals in their initial stages, requiring a simple approval threshold (or a designated set of approvers, 2/3) before progressing further. Focus on WHY we should go forward with the proposal.
3. Quadratic Governor: This Governor type, implemented using quadratic voting, is employed in the later stages of a proposal, allowing for more nuanced and weighted voting based on participants' preference intensity. Focus on HOW MUCH resources we should allocate and HOW we should implement the proposal.

In essence, the EnDAOsment's modular governance framework, through its CORE contract, provides a robust and adaptable system for managing proposals within the DAO, allowing for different voting mechanisms to be applied based on the specific stage of a proposal and its maturity.
